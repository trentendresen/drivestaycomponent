## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- A mobile emulator (Android Studio/Xcode) or the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app

### Installation

2. start the server

### Approach 
So I tried to not really use as much imported libararies as possible and mainly just used state variables to keep track of data but for a real app
 I would use either the DB or redux to keep track of state throughtout the whole app I used typescript to ensure typing
